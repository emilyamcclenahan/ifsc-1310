  <h2>Reflections:</h2>
  <p>I'd like to reflect not only on this particular project but this class in general.</p>
  <p>I'll start with the project. If you would have told me in September that I would be able to build a webpage I would've probably laughed! I didn't think that was something that I could learn. While I'm not entirely proud of this project(only because I'd like it to be top notch & I don't know enough yet) I am very proud of myself for the work that I put into it. This wasn't an easy project for me. I felt like along the way I was understanding everything you were teaching & then we'd move on to something else & I felt like I was forgetting what I previously learned. I had to do a lot of going back to look at what we had done previously to refresh my memory on most things.</p>
  
  <p>I did figure out how to go in & fix the hotlink issue. I also added A Slide Show page. I really enjoyed learning the JavaScript part of this. I enjoyed the Cycle project so I wanted to add the same thing to my SpaceX project. As you know, I had some little hiccups along the way. Overall I don't think they were terribly big issues & I was able to mostly work them out on my own. </p>
  
  <p>I asked my husband for feedback & he didn't really care for my color scheme. But, I plugged my main photo into Adobe Color & used their suggestions. Also, he's colorblind so I can't take his criticism seriously on that. I also asked my mother for feedback & she just kept saying it was perfect & she couldn't believe I knew how to do that.(eyeroll!) My feedback wasn't the greatest so I just used the feedback you gave me & things I initially knew I wanted to change myself.</p>
  
  <p>As for this class, I can't thank you enough for all of your help along the way! I can't imagine that it was an easy thing to teach online. I'm certain I would've loved the classroom setting if that could've been an option. I really struggle with doing online classes because I need that interaction regularly & to be able to get help face to face but I don't feel like we missed a beat. I thought you did a great job teaching under the circumstances. Also, I appreciate you always answering my e-mails & helping me out. I'm OCD to a fault & have a lot of questions so I apologize if I e-mailed you excessively. Again, thank you so so much for being so helpful & really making sure we all succeed!</p>
